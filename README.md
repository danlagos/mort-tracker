# mortgage-tracker

At the end of the day, I want to use this app to show you, a potential employer, my full-stack web developer skills while trying to solve a real world problem.

I am working on this project while I have a full-time job. I trust this will show how dedicated I am to learning this new skill, and will encourage you to take the risk in hiring me. Trust me, you are going to like what you see here!

Business problem I am trying to solve:  I am tired of the repetitive tasks I do at work.  We use google sheets for everything.  It is an inexpensive way of handling our reporting, but it is cumbersome.  We waste a lot of time (which means money) writing and updating reports that contain the same type of information accross each report (DRY!!!).

Solution:  I will build a full-stack web app using Vue.JS, vue-router, and vuex to track, and report our business tasks.  We are a mortgage company.

Features: This list will grow as I create my app

contact manager

To-Do list that attaches itself to clients.

Dashboard has to-do list.

Dashboard to-do list shows you the to-do item attached to the borrower

Dashboard counts how many clients are in each contact flow stage

Document the "contact flow" through the mortgage process (Though I have an outline for this, I will provide more detail later,  This is the heart of the app, as the entire app is meant to capture this business flow.).
